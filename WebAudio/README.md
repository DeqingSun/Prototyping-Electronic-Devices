Web Audio Playground
==========

This is the source code for the
[Web Audio Playground](http://webaudioplayground.appspot.com/)
application.

## Installation ##

To install the application locally,
[download a copy of the Python App Engine SDK](https://developers.google.com/appengine/downloads)
for your operating system, install it, point it at a check-out of this
repo and view the application on a local port using the latest version of
Google Chrome.

Alternately, you can simply host the directory structure on a local web server, and load index.html.  
(The app cannot be run from file:// as XMLHTTPRequest doesn't work.)
