The most difficult part of prototyping is not the building process, but the process of deciding how to build. If we choose proper technology for prototypes, we can improve their robustness and simplicity.

This course will cover available and affordable technologies for ITP students to build prototypes. The course will start from soldering, wiring and LED basics. Then it extends to multitasking, signal processing, communication and advanced skills beyond PCom class.

Each session will have lectures followed by in class practices with guidance. Workshop sessions during midterm and final period allow students to work on their own project with help from instructors. No required assignment.
